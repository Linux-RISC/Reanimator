<h1 style="color:white;">Network setup</h1>

<p style="color:white">
Reanimator includes a "Network assistant menu" in the "Network configuration menu". It allows to choose the network configuration according to your network setup.
<br>
<br>
By default, Reanimator is configured to be connected directly to the client computer or to a network switch. This is the simplest configuration:<br>

<br>
If you download the full version, serveral IRIX versions are included and it's the <b>best</b> solution for beginners.<br>
<br>
But if you use the lite version and you want to download IRIX versions for the Internet, you must connect the RBPi to the Internet. There are two options:<br>
<br>
<h4 style="color:white;">1. Wired network</h4>
<p style="color:white">
You must use a switch to connect the RBPi and the client computer to your wired network and modify the IP addresses and gateway (/etc/hosts, /etc/bootptab, /etc/dhcpcd.conf or /etc/network/interfaces using the "Networking menu") according to your network configuration. This is an example for a 192.168.9.0/24 network:<br>

<br>
This is the <b>fastest</b> setup to download IRIX versions from the Internet, but the configuration is <b>complex</b>.<br>
<br>
<h4 style="color:white;">2. Wi-Fi network</h4> 
<p style="color:white">
This is probably the most <b>common</b> case. If you use a Wi-Fi network to connect to the Internet, you can isolate the wired RBPi connection from the Wi-Fi network and use the RBPi as a router for your sgi computer. You must configure the Wi-Fi connection on the RBPi to connect to your Wi-Fi using the "Network assistant menu" in the "Network configuration menu":<br>

<br>
This is the <b>easiest</b> setup to download IRIX versions from the Internet and connect the sgi computer to the Internet, but the Internet speed is <b>limited</b> by the Wi-Fi connection.<br>
